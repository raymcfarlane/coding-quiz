Coding Quiz

The purpose of this homework challenge was to create a quiz for a user on Javascript.

I worked on the html file. I created the buttons for the quiz. I did not complete all of the funtionality for the site to be able to take the quiz and go through the questions. I plan on going back to complete the functionality once I understand how event listeners and functions work together more.
